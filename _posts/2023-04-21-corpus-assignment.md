You have so many books you want to read, do you not? As humans have always been inclined to making life easier and easier, we have a solution for that too, you do not need to read all your ever growing list of books in order to know the best and most worthy of reading books. 
Through computational text-analysis, you can become a far more efficient reader and even save your time for other things you enjoy instead of just going through books and at the end find out it was not worth it. You can get the main idea and much more about a book through the help of analysis and interpretive powers of computers. Tools such as Voyant are great at that. You can get word clouds, word frequencies, correlations, mandala, and many more.

The most common words revolve around the individual, their mind and experience, such as feeling or desire, pain, or thoughts. Ego and Life seem common words in Eckhart’s and David’s books, and Life is seen in the books of all these authors. 

Most of these books are within the genre of self-help books and one of the key terms or themes they focus on is enlightenment. Some others include: consciousness, personal growth, feeling, change, presence, vibration, etc. For example, from our research, the power of now seems to be about understanding what the mind is and transcending it through being present, connecting with one’s body, perceptions, and awareness that is beyond all of one’s conditioning. Whereas Letting Go seems to be about reaching ecstasy, peace, and enlightenment through surrendering. These books are very renowned, some of them being best-sellers, because of the impact they have on their readers. Besides writing books, these authors are known for guiding people, giving speeches or inspiring talks, organizing workshops, etc. 

**What we knew before doing the text analysis of these books?**
1. About the books of David Hawkins, they are scientific and explanatory as much as they are mystical. I think he has such a great ability to explain enigmatic matters such as higher levels of consciousness. He talks about transcendence and letting go.
2. Eckhart Tolle has a very simple language and yet is able to convey so much. His central idea revolves around presence and rising above thinking.
3. Esther Hicks has a very assertive and positive way of speaking. The main theme is the law of Attraction. 

### Wordclouds

#### Eckhart

<div class="row" style="display:flex;">
    <div class="column" style="flex: 50%; padding:5px">
        <figure style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="/wordclouds/Power of Now.png"/>
            <figcaption style=" font: italic smaller sans-serif;">Power of Now</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
     <div class="column" style="flex:50%; padding:5px">
        <figure style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="/wordclouds/a new earth.png"/>
            <figcaption style="font: italic smaller sans-serif;">A New Earth</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
</div>

The biggest words shown in the word clouds correlate with the titles as shown in “Consciousness” being the biggest in the book transcending levels of consciousness, and “surrender”,  “negative”, “feelings” among the biggest in Letting go, which does not only match with the title but also the core of the book which is achieving liberation through the mechanism of surrender. However, most of the words are similar (energy, love, spiritual, life), with the only difference being their frequency of usage in the books, which shows that although the author might be explaining different things in these 2 books, his philosophy is the same. The word self is used a lot in both. 


#### David

<div class="row" style="display:flex;">
    <div class="column" style="flex: 50%; padding:5px">
        <figure style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="/wordclouds/Letting go.png"/>
            <figcaption style=" font: italic smaller sans-serif;">Letting Go</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
     <div class="column" style="flex:50%; padding:5px">
        <figure style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="/wordclouds/T levels of consiusness.png"/>
            <figcaption style="font: italic smaller sans-serif;">Transcending Levels of Consciousnessh</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
</div>

Again, here too, many words between the two books are similar (present, moment, body, and consciousness the most). However, the Power of Now seems to be more central to the individual with the main idea revolving around mind, body, attention, and inner, whereas in “A new earth”, this main idea seems to be expanded in the larger scale of humanity with the words being: people, ego, human, purpose, painbody, etc. 

#### Esther Hicks

    <div class="column" style="flex: 50%; padding:5px">

            <figcaption style=" font: italic smaller sans-serif;">Ask and it is given</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
     <div class="column" style="flex:50%; padding:5px">
        <figure style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="/wordclouds/astonishing power of emotions.png"/>
