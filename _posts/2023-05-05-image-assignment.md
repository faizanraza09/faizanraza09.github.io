## Clustering Exercise

### Data Collection
For this step of my assignment, I decided to go with 30 different food pictures from around the world. I selected foods from different cuisines such as Mexican, Indian, Chinese and Thai. However I chose different types of foods such as salads, main courses and desserts so the cuisine is not the only classification they are based on as instructed by the Professor. The data collection process involved me searching up a list of famous traditional foods from the mentioned cuisines and then going to different websites and downloading images of the shortlisted foods.
