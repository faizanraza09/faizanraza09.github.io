A healthy owl population is a sign of a balanced ecosystem. In order for owls to thrive, populations of the species they prey upon must be abundant and healthy as well - a pattern that continues down the entire food chain. This means that if the health or number of prey species declines, something in the environment has changed and is altering the natural structure of the food web. A world without owls would spell trouble for humans, as their role as a top predator of rodents protects us from the spread of diseases and protects our crops from being raided. #owls #birds #video #PhotoArk #SuperbOwlDay @insidenatgeo
