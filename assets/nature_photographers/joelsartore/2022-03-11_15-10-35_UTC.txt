Very rare and highly secretive, not much is known about the endangered Geeâ€™s golden langur. Unlike other species of langurs that appear unafraid of humans, researchers have said that this monkey works hard to avoid human interactions, making them extremely difficult to observe in the wild. What we do know is that like other monkeys in the Colobinae subfamily, the golden langur has a stomach designed to break down the hard-to-digest cellulose in leaves, reflecting its diet of leaf buds, fruits, flowers, seeds, and twigs.
