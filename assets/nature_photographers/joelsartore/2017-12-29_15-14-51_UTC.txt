Meet Piper, a Brazilian porcupine photographed at the @STLzoo. She loves bananas and spending time outside. She’s very smart and will sit by the door that can access the outdoors almost every night waiting to be let out. By the morning she can always be found back inside, sound asleep in her enclosure. Her keepers say Piper is the prettiest porcupine they’ve ever had - and one of the sweetest! In April of 2016 Piper made her modeling debut on the cover of @NatGeo magazine.
