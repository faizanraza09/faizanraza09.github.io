I am excited to announce my Photo Ark Image of an endangered Malayan tapir is being featured in the National Geographic Image Collectionâ€™s Flash Sale. For a limited time, you can purchase my print and compliment it with a piece from the Image Collection by Carl Akeley from 1909. Visit the link in my bio to purchase.
