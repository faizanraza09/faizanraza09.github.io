These exuberant birds are vulturine guineafowl, photographed at @lincolnchildrenszoo here in Nebraska. They are gregarious creatures that flock in groups of up to 25 birds in the forests of central Africa. Though they live in open habitats, they are most comfortable when undercover and will roost in trees. Vulturine guineafowl are terrestrial, so rather than fly away when alarmed, as most birds do, they will run.
