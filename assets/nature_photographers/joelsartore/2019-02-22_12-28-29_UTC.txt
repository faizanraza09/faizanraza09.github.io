Very few rodents rate as high on the cuteness scale as the long-eared jerboa. Found in the deserts of Mongolia and China this species relies on its incredible jumping abilities to dodge birds of prey and other predators when it’s out foraging. Jerboas can also rapidly hop sideways to fake out and confuse their predators. The exact reason behind the jerboa’s endangered status isn’t entirely understood, but it has been suggested that it is due to habitat disturbance from mining activities, agriculture, and possibly climate change. The introduction of the domestic cat has put further pressure on this mammal – a good reminder to all of us to keep pet cats indoors whenever possible! Photo taken @moscow_zoo_official
