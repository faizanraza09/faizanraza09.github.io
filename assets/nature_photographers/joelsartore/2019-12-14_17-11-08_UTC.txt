Love monkeys like this endangered Peruvian woolly monkey @ibamagov? On this World Monkey Day, you can protect this, and hundreds of other species by pledging to not keep primates as pets. Monkeys like this one face many serious threats, but in cases like this, the illegal pet trade could very well lead to the speciesâ€™ undoing. In recent years, gray woolly monkeys have, unfortunately, become popular pets. Taking these monkeys from their forested home in the Amazon is often a heartbreaking process where mother monkeys are shot and killed, allowing for newly orphaned babies to be taken from the wild and sold via the pet trade. While protected areas like national parks can help to protect remaining populations and the land they depend on, the practice of illegally taking woolly monkeys out of the wild will continue to threaten their survival until the demand for monkeys as pets has been extinguished. #MonkeyDay #woollymonkey #peruvian #endangeredspecies #primate #monkey #cute #notapet #PhotoArk #savetogether
