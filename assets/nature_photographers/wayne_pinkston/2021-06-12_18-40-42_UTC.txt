How does this not fall over? ðŸ¤” Tread carefully! Iâ€™ve been off Instagram for a while but Iâ€™ve been shooting and scouting for new places in the SW. Iâ€™ve been fortunate to see some amazing landscapes and shoot in some fantastic sites, but most are still on my hard drive, so there is more to come! The wildfires are in full force now so fires and smoke could be a major problem in shooting going forward. I hope the fires spare the local population. This image is focus stacked and there is a different stack and exposure for the foreground and sky. Stacked every which way but loose, lol. ðŸ¤”
