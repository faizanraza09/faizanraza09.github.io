Saved by my light stand! I always thought carrying some lighting equipment on my night expeditions was useful, despite the naysayers, lol. The other night I tore my patellar tendon coming down a hill in the badlands, after dark and no one around. This means you have no support from your quads in the front of your leg and cannot bear weight or extend your leg. I couldn’t walk. I could lay there and wait all night and hope someone came the next day, or find a way to splint my leg. This is where the trusty light stand came in. I used the light stand as a long leg splint. I cut up a pair of long pants to tie the light stand securely to my leg. I liked those pants, sigh. Anyway, I was then able to hobble back to my car 1.25 miles away, about 2 km. Took 4 hours to go 1.25 miles, crawling up hill on all 4’s, sliding down hill on my butt, limping along when flat. The last video shows where I was at the.time. By the time I slid down the last hill my buttocks were in worse shape than my knee, lol. Finally made it to the ER 6 hours after the accident. So is it a good idea to go out alone? No, it is not a good idea, but being out in the remote places alone under the stars is very special and one of the very best parts of the whole experience. The resulting photos are nice, but being out there under the stars alone brings me a piece of mind like no other experience I know. Over time the experience has become more important than the photos. I always knew I might get in trouble out there alone, but had decided it was worth the risk. Do I regret that? No. Would I do it again? Probably yes, if I can ever walk properly again, lol. Surgery next to week to fix it, then 6 months rehab. I should be good by next Milky Way season! Yeah! I can go out and do it again! Yeah, I know, that’s loco. This will properly qualify for my Hall of Shame. Surgery, here I come! Gotta keep those orthopedists in business! My trusty tripod was my crutch, lol.
