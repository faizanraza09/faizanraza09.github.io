Big Hogan Arch in Monument Valley, Utah/Arizona. Big Hogan is aptly named. That little person holding the light is me. This is a vertical panorama. The opening in the upper portion of the photo is actually directly overhead, but projecting this on a rectangular image makes it look like it’s in the front wall. I’m still trying to figure out just what is the best way to depict the inside of a sphere in a rectangular photo. A fisheye lens probably works best, but it has its own sort of distortion. The arch is within the Monument Valley backcountry, and cannot be visited without a guide. If you want to visit then contact Majestic Monument Valley Tours. If you want a night tour then ask for Quanah Parker. ________________________________________ #biology_ecology
