One of my personal favorite aurora photos. I’ve included the RAW file if you are interested, just swipe left. Remember, the RAW file is flatter and less contrasts than what you might see. I’m including the RAW file because in the past I’ve gotten some push back from people saying I faked or photoshopped the image. I have increased the contrast in the sky with “curves”, and lightened the foreground and decreased the distortion in the foreground and that’s it for processing. The sky is so colorful that you really cannot do too much processing or the colors will get wildly out of gamut. This is from my archives from a few years ago. At the time I didn’t post many of these for 2 reasons, people kept calling them fake, and I wanted to concentrate on my Milky Way photos. I guess it’s time to free them from my hard drive, lol. Hope you enjoy! Wayne _______________________________________ Oh No, I messed up! This RAW file was the frame right before the actual frame, by 3 seconds, but it is representative anyway, and you can get the idea. its hard to tell them apart actually. 24 mm, f/1.4, 3.2 sec., ISO 8000. _______________________________________ Here’s a tip. If you want to see more of the shape of the aurora, the waves,  curtains, streaks, and rays, etc., then get your exposure time down as short as possible. The aurora moves and undulates and longer exposure times blurs all the fine structure out. Long exposures can also obscure small subtle areas of exotic colour. Use a fast lens. You can also use high ISO without much trouble. Yes, you get more noise, but you can use a lot of noise reduction on these photos without degradation of the image. Here I used 3.2 seconds, but wished it was even shorter. Thanks
