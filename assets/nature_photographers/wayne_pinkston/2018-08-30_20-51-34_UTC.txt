Moccasin Arch in Monument Valley. This is a photo of some of my fellow photographers taking photos within Moccasin Arch. I was taking photos of them while they were photographing the arch. It turned out that I liked this one more than the views looking straight outward from the arch. The photographers in the photo give you a sense of scale. The Arch is huge! A big thank you to Quanah from Majestic Monument Valley Tours for taking us there. Thank you! He is highly recommend if you want to take a night tour in Monument Valley (day tours also). This is a panorama of 4 stitched together images, 14 mm, f/2.8, 25 sec., ISO 8,000. Thanks for looking!
