(Swipe Left) The Balancing Act: This is another semi unsuccessful attempt to display a wide panorama on IG. I love wide panoramas and do bunches of them, and IG just hates them, lol, so hereâ€™s another one the size of a postage stamp. ðŸ˜‚ The jokes on me I guess. Swipe left to see the entire image. This is a fascinating spot in Utah thatâ€™s is seemingly rarely photographed, especially at night. There are miles of fabulous canyons. Iâ€™ve been there a number of times and never seen another person. There are still so many untapped locations for night photography. This is a panorama of stacked images. 12-24mm lens, 24 mm, f/2.8, 15 sec., ISO 6400.
