Moonlighting: This is a seldom photographed arch in a park where the lights no longer shine, lol. It’s a pretty spectacular view looking out from inside the arch, looking out over high desert, canyons, and hills. It’s off the beaten track and you have to hike in or do some serious 4 wheeling to get there. I have not seen any night photos from here previously. To get the whole scene into the image I ended up with a bit of a fisheye effect, but it was taken with a rectilinear lens, a Sony 12-24 mm f/2.8. This is a blend panorama. The foreground was captured with moonlight, and the sky was captured before the moon rose. Foreground was captured at 12 mm and is a complex multiple row multi angle panorama lighted by moonlight. The sky was captured at 21 mm, with separate panoramas for the lower sky and upper sky. The arch is more flat than shown here with the fisheye effect making it look more curved.
