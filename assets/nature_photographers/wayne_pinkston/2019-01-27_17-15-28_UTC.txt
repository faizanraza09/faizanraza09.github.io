Panorama of the Aurora in Signaldalen, Norway. Who would have thought that a panorama of the aurora would even work? Not me! I did this panorama several years ago because I could not capture the whole scene with the lens I had. It sat on my hard drive until yesterday, I had no hope that it actually worked. I was surprised when I stitched it in Lightroom. Yeah! 9 images, vertical, 24 mm lens, f1.4, 10 sec. (too long!), ISO 10,000. Canon 1Dx.  We get a peak of the Milky Way also! Yeah again!_______________________________________ Continuing my panorama binge. ðŸ˜€ Top 60 panoramas, counting down, No.  21. I love panoramas and they are a major part of my photography, but for a long time I mostly avoided posting them on IG because itâ€™s hard to do them justice here. They are just too small to catch you attention and as a result they get a lot less views and much less attention. Panoramas on IG make a postage stamp look large in comparison! I have finally just decided to go ahead and post them anyway. Because Iâ€™ve mostly avoided posting them there is a bit of a backlog. There will be several versions of each, a regular version, a swipe left version, and sometimes a short video version. Hope you enjoy!
