I knew that no matter what picture I managed to make of this beautiful mother humpback whale and her calf, it would never do them, their bond, their incomprehensible size, their mystical appearance or their blue world any semblance of justice.  They, together, floating motionless in the water column, just above the sea floor, the baby tucked safely under her chin in perfect harmony and connectedness.  I free dove down to 40 feet and slowly drifted back towards the surface, looking back at the mom's eye, assessing her level of comfort while taking in the scene before me in its entirety.  I had a hard time bringing the camera to my own eye as the moment was not meant to be experienced through a camera viewfinder.  And yet, all of the work we do at @sealegacy is supported by you and I could not be more excited to share the pictures, video and stories that we have been so fortunate to capture over the past three weeks in the Kingdom of Tonga. You have allowed us to protect ecosystems and the species that call them home. You form #TheTide at @sealegacy and I dedicate this moment to you. Now, the heavy lifting by our campaign team back in the office begins.  Mom and her rapidly growing calf soon will begin their 7000 kilometre journey back to Antarctica where she will replenish her weight and strength. May the waters around Antarctica be protected in the near future. #MPA  @sonyalpha
