Is this how you would want to start the new year? Australia is burning. These fires have made climate change a reality of the present tense for many Australians. It is no longer something that we can put off to the future. To give some scale of the intensity of these fires, international media outlets have been reporting the 2018 California fires burnt 2 million acres; the 2019 Amazon fires 2.2 million, and the 2019 Siberian fires 6.7 million. So far, Australia's 2019/20 fires have burnt 12 million acres. It is time to stop talking about climate change and start acting.
