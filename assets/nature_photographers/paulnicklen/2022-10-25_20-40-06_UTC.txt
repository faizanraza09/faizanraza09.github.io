‘Megaptera’ - On the day I captured this 8k video and, ultimately, the limited edition art print behind it, the main question running through my mind was how to position myself with as little movement as possible so this mother humpback and her calf would not be disturbed. I observed from the surface for over an hour before finally daring to make my attempt, descending forty feet on a single breath before inching towards them. As I drew closer, all of the elements of a perfect and tender moment seemed to come together in a fraction of a second: the hula skirt of remoras clinging to mom’s waist, her calf tucked up under her chin, and her nearly 14-foot-long pectoral fin lifted to balance the image. When her fin moved ever so slightly, I wondered; was she compensating for the calf pushing against her, or was I getting too close? No picture is worth agitating an animal, so I decided to gently create some distance before allowing myself to drift upwards without a single kick. I am proud of the relationship I maintain with wildlife – at the end of the day, it is the most important part of my job.
