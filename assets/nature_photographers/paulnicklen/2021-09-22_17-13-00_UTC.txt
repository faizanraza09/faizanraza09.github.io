Please comment with a ðŸ’” if you find these images of slaughtered white-sided dolphins as horrific as I do. They are the victims of a traditionalÂ dolphin hunt called GrindadrÃ¡p (or "The Grind") that takes place annually on the shores of the Faroe Islands, an archipelago between Iceland and Norway. Last week's horrific event is estimated to be the largest single cull in the island's history, with even seasoned whalers deeming the slow, cruel mass killing of over 1,400 white-sided dolphins in a single day unethical. I don't believe "tradition" is an adequate justification for this senseless practice. In fact, I can't think of a single reason why it should be allowed to continue. If you agree, please visit the link in my bio and sign our @OnlyOne petition urging the Faroese Prime Minister to end the GrindadrÃ¡p for good. With @SeaLegacy.
