ðŸ”ˆ // I want to share one of the most special encounters Iâ€™ve ever had on this yearâ€™s #WorldOceansDay. We discovered this devoted mother humpback basking in the warm waters off the coast of Tonga, patiently waiting for her baby to grow and building strength for the long journey back to their feeding grounds in Antarctica. The whale song of a distant male filled the waters around me as I descended into position to capture the moment. I filmed for as long as I could, bid a silent farewell, and gently floated to the surface so as not to disturb them. There are some breath-hold dives where the experience is so mesmerizing I completely forget about the burning sensation in my lungs â€“ this was one of them. With @Scott.Portelli in Tonga under Special Interaction Permit (Regulation 13) from the Ministry of Tonga. #Whale #Humpback #Calf #Mother #Baby #Tonga #Underwater #FreeDive #Wildlife #Nature #NatureLovers #Gratitude #Breathless
