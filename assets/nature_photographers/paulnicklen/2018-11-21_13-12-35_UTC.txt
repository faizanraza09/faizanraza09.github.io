Some wildlife species are born with the flight response and others are just born with 100 percent attitude and confidence like this baby fur seal.  I was hiking through the tall grass on South Georgia, Antarctica to go and photograph wandering albatross when this seal came charging out at me.  I apologized for the intrusion, tried to not be insensitive by laughing out loud and carried on my way. Images like this would never make my fine art book #borntoice but the memories are fresh and vivid. May that never change. #gratitude #nature #antarctica #adventure #explore
