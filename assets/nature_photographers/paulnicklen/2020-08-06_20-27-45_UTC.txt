ðŸ”ˆ // There are some breath-hold dives where the experience is so mesmerizing I completely forget about the burning sensation in my lungs. This was one of those occasions. As the whale song of a distant male reverberated through my body, this devoted mother humpback basked in the warm waters off the coast of Tonga â€“ patiently waiting for her baby to grow, and building strength for the long journey back to their feeding grounds in Antarctica. I bid a silent farewell before gently floating to the surface so as not to disturb them. With @scott.portelli and @kyle.roepke in Tonga under Special Interaction Permit (Regulation 13) from the Ministry of Tonga. #whale #humpback #calf #mother #baby #tonga #underwater #freedive #wildlife #nature #naturelovers #gratitude #breathless
