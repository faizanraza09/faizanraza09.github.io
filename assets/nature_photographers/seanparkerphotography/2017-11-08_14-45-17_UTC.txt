Iâ€™m currently on a layover in Iceland as I head back home to the desert. Iâ€™ve spent the last 20 days in the Arctic and had a complete blast. I spent 10 of those days alone exploring Lofoten and was completely  blown away by itâ€™s beauty. Even though I didnâ€™t have the best weather, I still saw some of Lofotenâ€™s best places in good light. I plan on returning next year and excited to announce that Iâ€™ll be  providing workshops there starting late next year! Stay tuned for more info on that. Anyways, I wanted to share this video from our #thorseanworkshop group in Iceland a couple weeks ago. Thor and I are so fortunate to have fun and talented clients. Thank you all who came! Canâ€™t wait to share some of my photos and theirs on my FB page when I get home. Be sure to check out our party bus video on my @seanparkeradventures account. ðŸŽ¶:@odesza
