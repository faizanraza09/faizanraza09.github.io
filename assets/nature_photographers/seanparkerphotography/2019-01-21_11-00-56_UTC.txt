Total Lunar Eclipse seen from the Sonoran Desert last night! Here is a ‚Äútimelapse‚Äù photo showing all the stages of the eclipse as it rose over the Tucson mountains. This photo was challenging to create and is not a composite. I set up my camera and took a timelapse of the eclipse, then took one long exposure for foreground, then stacked it all using exposure / layer blending in photoshop. I‚Äôm not great at photoshop stuff so it took me like 2 hours just to edit it making this image 8 hours of work üòÇ. I shot this with a side angle lens which is why the moon looks small. In reality the moon was a bit larger than a full moon but you couldn‚Äôt really tell with the naked eye.

Anyways I hope you enjoy the image. Weather was pretty poor here on the west coast so my workshop client and I made the best of it. How was the view where you live? I‚Äôll be answering any questions and responding to comments when I can. I‚Äôm just now getting to bed!

PS I just launched my spring milkyway workshops and they‚Äôre already filling up. I launched them early for newsletter subscribers so make sure you sign up on my website soon! Link in bio.
