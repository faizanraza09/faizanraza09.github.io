A few photos from the bighorn fire taken last night in Tucson, AZ.  The situation has gotten pretty bad over the last couple days and some foothills residents have been evacuated as of today.  It’s so sad to see our beautiful mountains on fire. As natural and needed as this is for the ecosystem, I fear it might be too extreme. Fingers crossed they get this under control quickly and safely! PS - don’t fly your drones around the fires! There have been way to many illegal drones recently and it’s interfering with the firefighters above. You get get a pretty hefty fine if you’re caught.
