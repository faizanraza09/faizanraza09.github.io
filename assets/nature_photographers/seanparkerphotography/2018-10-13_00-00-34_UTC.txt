Falcon 9 Rocket Launch
—————
I’m still so happy that I got to witness the Falcon 9 Rocket Launch last Sunday evening. It was such an unforgettable experience! Seeing the sky light up as if a comet just entered our atmosphere and created a Nebula was such a surreal moment. Something you could only see in dreams or a video game turned into reality. Turn your sound on and watch this video! It’s condensed into 1 minute but the whole event lasted around 12 minutes. So beautiful, I wish it stayed in the sky haha.
