Science!

I’m still having difficulties putting @spacex’s Falcon 9 Launch experience into words last night. It was just crazy. By far one of the coolest things I have ever seen next to a total solar eclipse and the aurora borealis. It just didn’t seem real. It was like a dream or CGI in a video game. What started off as a small firework, exploded into a giant space nebula that lasted what seemed like a few minutes, but was actually around 15 minutes long. What’s even more impressive is that the rocket eventually landed itself after sending the satellite it was carrying into orbit. Keep an eye out for the next night launch, you won’t be disappointed!
