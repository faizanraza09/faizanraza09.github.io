Another shot of Comet Neowise taken yesterday morning just before sunrise! This is THE comet to see. Make sure you look to the NE between 4-4:30am in the next couple days. Binoculars are recommended unless in a dark place then you can see with the naked eye 💫  view my story for a map how to find it!
