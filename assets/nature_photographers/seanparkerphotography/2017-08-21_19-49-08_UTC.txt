"Totality"
-
The Great American Eclipse

I don't even know where to begin...it was so surreal. Being under a pitch black sun surrounded in near darkness watching stars suddenly come out in the sky. It was just like a dream and the most incredible thing I've ever seen! I couldn't believe my eyes. Who else got to see totality and can explain it better than me? I'd love to hear what you felt when you saw the moon cross in front on the sun today and where you witnessed the event!

Note: This is a quick edit we took through a @canonusa 6DMKII and Canon 100-400 with a x2 multiplier (no solar filter needed during totality.) If you look closely you can see some of the solar flares at the top and to the right! If you'd like to license my image, please email me!
