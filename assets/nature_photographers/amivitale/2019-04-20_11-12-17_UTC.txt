Photo by @amivitale. UPCOMING TALKS: I am speaking on May 8th in San Antonio and May 9th in St. Paul. On May 8, I’ll be at The Nature Conservancy (@nature_org) San Antonio Conservation Luncheon, talking about the most important conservation issues facing people and the planet today.On May 9, I’ll continue the @natgeo Live series at The Fitzgerald Theater (@firstavenue) in St. Paul, delivering the talk Rhinos, Rickshaws, and Revolutions.

I'd love to see you there. Visit my website amivitale.com to get all the details (link in profile.) Here is a powerful example of the work being done to save wildlife. In 2014, I witnessed a group of Samburu warriors encounter a rhino for the first time in their lives at Lewa Wildlife Conservancy (@lewa_wildlife). None of the warriors had ever seen a rhino in the their life and some had never even seen a photo of a rhino. Their eyes got wide and they became very protective of them. The young warriors from Northern Rangelands Trust (@nrt_kenya) community conservancies had been visiting to learn about conservation practices such as sustainable land use, grazing programs and endangered species conservation. indigenous communities are the frontlines of the poaching wars. The Nature Conservancy in Africa (@nature_africa), @nrt_kenya and @lewa_wildlife are doing incredible work to strengthen these communities, who hold the key to saving Africa's great animals.
