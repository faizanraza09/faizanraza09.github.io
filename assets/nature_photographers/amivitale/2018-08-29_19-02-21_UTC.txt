Video by @amivitale. A little slurpy, a little slobbery, but very satisfying. Lemorijo gets his afternoon bottle from Matiba. The rapidly growing orphaned baby elephants are fed two liter bottles of special formula every three hours, 24-hours per day. That means Lemorijo, in the more than 8 months he's been at Reteti, has drunk more than 2,000 bottles of milk. 
Reteti Elephant Sanctuary (@r.e.s.c.u.e), in northern Kenya is the first ever community-owned and run elephant sanctuary in Africa. The sanctuary provides a safe place for injured elephants to heal and later, be returned back to the wild.
