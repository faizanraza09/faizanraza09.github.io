Photo by @amivitale. I'm thrilled to be launching my new film Shaba about the extraordinary story of Reteti Elephant Sanctuary (@r.e.s.c.u.e)'s first matriarch. It is now online and your ticket sales will go directly to support the elephants and their incredible keepers. The film will be available on-demand from today until World Elephant Day on the 12th of August. Visit shabafilm.org or click on the link in my profile to watch today. 

Reteti is the first ever community-owned and run elephant sanctuary in Africa. Here, orphaned baby elephants graze following their keeper Lmeitekini. At Reteti, the older elephants care for the younger ones. Then, as the younger ones age, they learn to care for the new orphans each in succession.
