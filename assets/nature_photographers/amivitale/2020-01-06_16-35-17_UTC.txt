Video by Oakbank Balhannah CFS/Photo by @mattabbottphoto. A continent is on fire. Uncontrollable bush fires are sweeping through Australia and it can only be described as apocalyptic. Right now, it's been estimated that a BILLION native animals have been killed. Thousands of people are trapped by fires and thousands are trying to reach safety. As of Friday, more than 12 million acres (an area about the size of Vermont and New Hampshire) have been consumed and at least 20 people were killed. Homes have been destroyed and this is only the beginning of the fire season. 30% of the forest in New South Wales has been burned, a number that may increase to 50% this week.

At times like these, the only thing I know how to do to not feel powerless is to try to help. If you'd like to get involved, @wildlifevictoria and @wireswildliferescue are rescuing and caring for thousands of sick, injured and orphaned native animals. Donate at wildlifevictoria.org.au/donate/ (link in profile) or wires.org.au/blog/emergency-donations-to-help-wildlife (Or check the @wildlifevictoria and @wireswildliferescue profiles for links). Or you can donate to help support the South Australian Country Fire Service Support Fund, the team who gave this koala water at cfsfoundation.org.au/donate . @cbsnews also has a great list of other groups working to help those impacted by these fires at cbsnews.com/news/australia-fires-how-to-help-victims-evacuees-firefighters-animals-wildfires/. And, one more thing you can do right now - contact your elected officials and let them know that the time to fight climate change is now. Fires and other cataclysmic events will only get worse as our planet heats up. We are all in this together.
