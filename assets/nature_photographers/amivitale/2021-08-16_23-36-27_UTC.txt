Photos by @amivitale. The Taliban have taken control of Afghanistan. How can we turn our backs on all the innocent human beings who will be targeted? I will be searching for ways we can help. This post from the @GeorgetownUniversity Institute for Women, Peace and Security at giwps.georgetown.edu/how-to-save-the-lives-of-afghan-women/ is a good place to start (link in profile.) In the meantime, we can support humanitarian visas, support those protecting those who spoke out and ask the U.S. government to make protecting women, minorities and activists a priority. 

@FastCompany has also written an article on getting involved. Go to fastcompany.com/90666326/how-to-help-afghanistan-things-you-can-do-right-now-for-a-country-in-crisis to help today. (Link in profile.)
