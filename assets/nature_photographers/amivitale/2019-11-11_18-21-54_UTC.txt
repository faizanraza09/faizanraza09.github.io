Photo by @amivitale. Enveloped in clouds, Mt. Kenya towers over the wide open plains of @OlPejeta Conservancy in northern Kenya. At more than 17,000 feet, Mt. Kenya is the highest mountain in Kenya and the second highest in Africa after Tanzania's Kilimanjaro. The mountain is spiritually significant to all of the indigenous communities who live in the area. The Gikuyu and Embu believe that God lived on the mount when he came down from heaven so they built their homes with their doors facing the mountain. (Kenya means God's resting place.) The Maasai believe their ancestors came from the mountain at the beginning of time. Managed by @kenyawildlifeservice, it is both a @UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and a World Heritage Site.
