2022 favorites, as told by instagram analytics (not in order)

1 - the time i was with @vmdws & we ran into @jj.trailwalker & @michelle.lawrencee and i asked vaughn & michelle to do a little dancy dance for a shot (they had never even met before 😂)
2 - montana magic moment 
3 - my fourth time doing the same trail in the span of a month and getting a tiny moon over wildflowers when @sadowskaphoto came to spend a week in the van with me 
4 - washington summers being magic as always 
5 - the time i saw horses in white sands and cried from how beautiful the world is and being kinda sad there was no one around to see it with me 
6 - a morning in the Tetons with @megbatphoto & @showupanyway. it was freakishly cold for being late july
7 - the rainbow i saw while backpacking chain lakes this summer and not a SINGLE PERSON i was with wanted to sprint a half mile to see it over the lake with me 😭 (also a happy moment because my 13 year old chihuahua backpacked with me like the good old days🥹)
8 - my first time going to this spot after getting a camera. i had gone a few times before i started my photo journey and honestly getting there and having a camera was so overwhelming bc everything was beautiful. s/o @meghanorourkee for standing in this 🫶🏼
9 - a magical moody moment from my birthday this october with my good pals @itsloganmarie & @miss.rover 
10 - this photo i took before my photo journey started really taking off, from the last weekend in february 2020 before the world changed forever
