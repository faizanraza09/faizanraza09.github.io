some of my favorite photos from my 26th revolution around the sun 🫶🏼

i’m not gonna be corny and write 27 things i’ve learned in my 27th year bc i’m pretty sure everyone is just winging it all the time anyway. and if they tell you they aren’t then they’re lying. also i don’t have 27 pieces of advice at the top of my head. 

this past year has been incredible—switching from the Subaru to living in a van… living out the second year of living my dream… being able to see places i’ve never seen… meeting new people who feel like the people you’ve known forever. love that for me tbh. 

the biggest lesson of 26 is honestly a super contradictory one. i’ve had to learn to slow down a lot which has been challenging at times, and much needed at others. ever since i was little i’ve always had a fear of never having enough time to do everything i love or see everything i want to see. when i worked in retail i rarely spent my days off sitting still for that reason. and truthfully, after watching a category 4 hurricane destroy the place i used to call home live on national television has really made a lot of that anxiety worse. i think the fear stems from never wanting to forget the places i love and never wanting the happy moments with the people i love to disappear. it’s a hard pill to swallow but there will never be enough time. and i think the harder pill for me to swallow was that rushing to do it all as fast as possible isn’t the cheat code to experiencing everything. but book that flight, call your bestie, visit your hometown. visit places twice, repeat your favorite hikes, go to that restaurant you love even if there’s something new you haven’t tried yet. enjoy the small comforts in life every now and again, there’s nothing about life that’s a race

there’s so much beauty in slowing down and learning to love the in between. most of my nostalgia for anywhere stems from missing the in between… it’s always been the journey that has the most memories. there’s so many things i never want to forget and i think that’s a sign of a life well lived so far. this is a massive ramble all to say: take more pictures, don’t take tomorrow for granted, and don’t rush great moments 🫶🏼
