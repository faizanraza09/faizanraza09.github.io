Looks can be deceiving. To be fair, this looked and sounded like a terrifying moment, but what sounded dire to us was basically the equivalent of a kid getting in big trouble. The cub is Little Davey (the same cub seen carrying the salmon in my previous post) and the large bear is her mom. Little Davey had gotten a little too bold and earnest with begging mom for clams and trying to take them as they were digging on the tidal flats. Mom had had enough and let her cub know it. If you look closely, you’ll see the sow is pressing, her paws resting on the cub, not digging in. She’s pushing, not biting down. And even in this moment, she is keeping an eye on the rest of the tidal flats. The whole interaction was terrifyingly loud and lasted about 2 seconds. I got this photo almost because I was startled into pressing the shutter and happened to be framed right. The next several images are from almost immediately after the literal smack down. It’s a harsh, but important lesson for the cub to learn. If she tried doing this with the wrong bear, her consequences could’ve been much different. This made it all the more amazing when on another morning we watched this same sow deliver a whole fish to her cub, sacrificing her own sustenance to make sure Little Davey didn’t go hungry. What do you think? Does it look like Little Davey learned her lesson? #bearlife #alaskaadventure #cookinlet @summitworkshops #sonyalphafemale #respectnature
