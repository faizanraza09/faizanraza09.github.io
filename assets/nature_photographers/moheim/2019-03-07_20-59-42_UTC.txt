A few years ago tallgrass prairie bison, a managed wild herd at The Nature Conservancy’s Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Oklahoma, fell ill with a deadly bacteria called Mycoplasma bovis. At the time there was no cure, and almost the entire herd of over 2,000 bison had tested positive. The illness, which resembles pneumonia, had a more than 50 percent mortality rate. But an experimental vaccine developed by a veterinarian from @tedturneriii’s ranch provided a glimmer of hope. Facing a near catastrophic loss of the herd, which would ripple with repercussions throughout the Preserve, TNC decided to deploy the vaccination. To do so, they had to roundup the herd during the spring, shortly after many had given birth, and give each animal a shot of potentially life-saving medicine. This photo is from that following fall, as once again bison were rounded up and tested for the illness. The experiment proved to be a success, and not one bison was lost that year to the illness. I was honored to photograph this endeavor both in the spring and fall for @nature_orgs magazine. #bison #thenatureconservancy #tallgrass #prairie #successstories #ranching #oklahoma #tedturner #hope
