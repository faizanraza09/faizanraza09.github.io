An endangered Columbia Basin Pygmy Rabbit is all curiosity as it triggers a camera trap in a remnant of sagebrush steppe in south-central Washington State. At one point, these rabbits, the smallest bunny in North America, numbered at just 16 individuals. Now roughly 100 roam free in the wild, thanks to hard-fought conservation efforts by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, The Nature Conservancy and an array of other groups and generous individuals. Last summer, it was my honor to photograph a story about these cutie pies for Nature Conservancy Magazine, and am so excited to finally be able to share some of the images here. I will be highlighting some of my faves and the stories behind them over coming posts, but thought Iâ€™d start with this show-stopper. #bunniesofinstagram #pymgyrabbits #columbiabasin #savethebunnies #Washington #onassignment #cameratrapping #endangeredspecies #wildlifeconservation @nature_org @alexsnyderphoto @melissa.dale.photo
