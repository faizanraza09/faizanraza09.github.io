A herd of capybara enjoy a little afternoon cool off in the waters of the The Aurora in Los Llanos, Colombia. This wetland, grassland ecosystem shares many of the characteristics of the Pantanal of Brazil. The capybaras found here tend to herd in larger groups than in other parts of South America. It was not unusual to see dozens lounging in a single stretch of water. These remarkable creatures are not endangered, though have faced enormous pressures from habitat loss and poaching. Also, just imagine. Everything with sharp teeth wants to eat them. No wonder, like one of the gentlemen in this photo, they are very observant. I found living among them while at Los Llanos to be such a paradox. I literally had them wondering around my feet while at dinner and one even bounced off my screen door when it tried to come in, and then other times they would scream their alarm call and manically charge into the water if the wind blew the wrong way. So grateful I had the chance to spend a little time with them while working on the #theBirders film series with @wherenextlife and @procolombiaco  The feature documentary film series launched this week! #sillyanimals #capybara #colombia #colombiawild #llanos #photoadventures
