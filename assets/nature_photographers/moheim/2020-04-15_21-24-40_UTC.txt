He’s working on his GQ moment. My dog Javier just happened to find his light the other evening while lounging on the couch. As we shelter-in-place we shift attention more immediately to our surroundings. Right before making this image I was chopping vegetables. When the light and moment happens, it happens. Don’t let it pass you by. Thank you Javi for being such a muse. #dogsofinstagram #dutchshepherd  #petportrait #shelterinplace
