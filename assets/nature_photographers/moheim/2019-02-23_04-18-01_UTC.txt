I swear burrowing owls have eyelashes. These tiny owls were among my favorite birds photographed while in Los Llanos of Colombia. Though I had lived in Colorado, where you can also find burrowing owls, I never managed to get a good look at them until venturing to Colombia. They are so much smaller than I realized. These owls were so tolerant of a clumsy human doing the most inelegant version of “the worm” in an effort to get closer. I laid in the dirt as the sun set just watching them be a little pair. I love that they didn’t even look at me much. It was clear I was visiting them in what was considered a safe place to them. The ranchers, Llaneros, have done such a good job taking care of the land. Of course, you still need to operate under the unspoken but agreed upon rules of engagement, but in Los Llanos we are just another animal in their ecosystem, and not one that comes with the label of predator.
