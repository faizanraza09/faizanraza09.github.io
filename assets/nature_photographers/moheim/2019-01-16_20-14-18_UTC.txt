So excited to return to Santa Cruz Island tomorrow to continuing documenting the story of the island scrub jay, a beauty and absolute smarty-pants of a bird. Island scrub jays are only found on one island in the world, right off the southern California coast. Numbering at only about 3,000 individuals, they are very imperiled, the result of a long history of habitat loss and now climate change. But biologists and conservationists arenâ€™t giving up hope. Stay tuned for an exciting upcoming story for Audubon Magazine, written by the fabulous Sarah Gilman! @sarahmoesix  #birdsofinstagram #santacruzisland #islandscrubjay #climatechange #wildcalifornia
