A little thing flying fearless into the world...that is what I feel every time I look at this photo of a long-tailed tyrant leaping into the sky. It reminds me to be brave, but to do it like we’re saying, “well of course this is what you do.” I had the good fortune of watching this beautiful bird while working #onassignment in Colombia’s Pacific Coast, a truly magical wild experience. Thank you to @cristinamittermeier for everything you have shared over the years. Thank you for being such an example for women in the fields of photography and conservation! This post is for you. So much love to you! #womenphotographers #community #strength #wonder #lovenature #raiseeachotherup #colombia #beautifulbirds #beautifulcolombia
