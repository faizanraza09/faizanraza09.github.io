What do you love about bison? As I once again work on assignment in the northern reaches of the Midwest, I am reminded of other projects where I’ve had the privilege of seeing and appreciating the Great Plains. One of the memories that sticks with me most was the time I got to spend with the bison protected at The Nature Conservancy’s Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Pawhuska, Oklahoma. At a little over 2,000 individuals, it seemed like I was swimming in a sea of bison. And to think megaherds many thousand strong once roamed these same hills in what was one of the world’s grandest ecosystems. Millions of bison all across the plains. This is likely the most bison I will ever see at once in my lifetime. But what you see here is hopefully on a trajectory towards more of these magnificent and important animals. Experiences like this are one of the things I treasure most about getting to share these stories. On another note, over my next few posts (which I hope to make more frequent) I’m aiming to make albums highlighting a few species and places from the archives. Would love to hear what you like about these creatures and places. #bison #greatplains #oklahoma #freedomtoroam #rejuvenation #lovenature #whywelovenature #midwest #onassignment #wonder
