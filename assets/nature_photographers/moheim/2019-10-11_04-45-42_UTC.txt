The three of us knelt around her, and without a word placed the flowers that would make her final bed. We found her on the road that takes you into Grand Teton National Park via Jackson Hole. She was so perfect, no scars or blemishes or signs of hardship marked her body, except the unnatural angle of her neck. Though the life had already left her before we found her, she still felt warm beneath our palms. Not five hours later, I would pass the body of a brown bear, killed moments before by an early morning driver, its paws cupped around its face as it lay across the double yellow line of the road leading from Jackson Hole to Teton Village. Everywhere you look signs blare with words to slow down for wildlife. But drivers grow impatient and zoom around cars in their rush for sunrises and to be there first. This is the price. But it doesnâ€™t have to be. Teton County residents vote for the wildlife bridges in your SPET ballot. Save the thing that makes where you live so special. You can vote for more than one item on the ballot. Make sure this is one of them. Show your wildlife that you care. Thank you @brooketalbott17 and @mariahwind for finding this girl and paying respects to her together. It meant so much to do this with you. #SPET2019 #jacksonhole #grandtetons #wildlifecrossing #coyote @summitworkshops @ilcp_photographers
