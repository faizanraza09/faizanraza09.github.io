Richard and Grace, Zimbabwe, 2020, photographed together, from the new series, The Day May Break, currently @photolondonfair, and exhibition opening today @faheykleingallery in Los Angeles.
.
Originally a maize farmer & cattle owner, extended droughts from 2010 began to dramatically impact Richard's livelihood. All of Richardâ€™s cows died from disease. He turned to farming tobacco to survive. Richard now struggles to provide for his family and send his kids to school.
.
Richard feels the reduction in rainfall has been caused not just by climate change, but also by the clearing of forests for the production & curing of tobacco, leaving vast barren stretches of land.
.
Grace - a bateleur eagle - was rescued by Kuimba Shiri Bird Sanctuary as a chick 40 years ago, due to large areas in Zimbabwe also cleared for cattle farming.
.
As a result, the bateleur range is mainly restricted to the big game parks and is is now listed as endangered.
.
The Day May Break is the first part of a global series portraying people and animals impacted by environmental destruction. The people in the photos have all been badly affected by climate change - some displaced by cyclones that destroyed their homes, others such as farmers displaced & impoverished by years-long severe droughts.
.
The photos were taken at 5 sanctuaries/ conservancies. The animals are almost all long-term rescues, due to everything from poaching of their parents to habitat destruction & poisoning.
.
These animals can never be released back into the wild. Now habituated, the people and animals were PHOTOGRAPHED TOGETHER IN THE SAME FRAME.
.
Created by fog machines on location, the fog is the unifying visual, causing a once-recognizable world to fade from view.
.
However, these people & animals are the survivors. And there lies possibility and hope. 
.
