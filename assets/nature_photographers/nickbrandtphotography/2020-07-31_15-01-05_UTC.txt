I wish that I had never had to take this photo. 
I wish that it had never been possible to take this photo.

Photos are:
LINE OF RANGERS HOLDING TUSKS KILLED AT THE HANDS OF MAN, AMBOSELI 2011 
ELEPHANTS WALKING THROUGH GRASS, AMBOSELI 2008 
(SWIPE to see).
.
The rangers photo was taken as a visual echo of Elephants Walking Through Grass, a very different world - a vision of paradise and plenty - taken only a couple of miles away three years earlier. The herd in that photo is being led by a wonderful matriarch. Photographed in 2008, she was 44 years old at the time. The following year, she was killed by poachers.
.
In the rangers photo, the 22 rangers are holding the tusks of elephants killed at the hands of man within the Amboseli/Tsavo Ecosystem.
The tusks of the elephant at the front? I think it’s safe to say there is barely an elephant left alive on the continent of Africa with tusks that size.
.
However, there is hope ---
.
The rangers holding the tusks are some of the 300+ rangers employed by Big Life Foundation (@biglifeafrica), the organization that I co-founded in 2010 with Richard Bonham to protect the animals and ecosystem of this region.
.
Today, these rangers protect the elephants and other animals of this unique ecosystem across 1.6 million acre area, straddling Kenya and Tanzania.
.
Since Big Life was founded, the incidence of poaching has dramatically dropped in the ecosystems that the rangers patrol.
.
But it is not easy to maintain this success. We need financial support. Please go to biglife.org to learn more, and donate today.
.
Technical : The tusks were stored in Kenya Wildlife Service’s ivory strongroom. In July 2011, they permitted me to borrow them. (They will have all since been burned at the ivory burn in Nairobi).
.
Shot as always on medium format black and white film, the Rangers photograph is published in “Across The Ravaged Land”, the elephant photo in “On This Earth, A Shadow Falls”, both available from bookstores, on Amazon,
