In the weeks before the shoot, several researchers traveled the country, meeting people badly impacted by climate change. Because these animals were rescues - victims of habitat destruction, wildlife trafficking and more - the people then had to travel to @senda_verde Sanctuary where the animals live. 

Photos:
2. Carmen and Tarkus, Bolivia, 2022
(A single electrified wire kept Tarkus the bear safely separated from people during the shoot, something that he recognizes as his enclosure has an electrified fence.)

4. Luis and Hernak, Bolivia, 2022 
(A large sheet of glass was placed between Luis and Hernak so they could be photographed together in the same frame).
