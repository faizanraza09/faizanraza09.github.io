JOHN AND MAK, ZIMBABWE, 2020, photographed together for the new series & book, The Day May Break (swipe for Making of). This is the first part of a global series portraying people and animals impacted by environmental destruction. 
.
John lives with his wife Margaret, and their 9 grandkids in Zimbabwe. Like so many others, the main challenge is not having access to water. The family walks 2 km every day to collect water. Because of the prolonged droughts, their small farming plot remains unplanted. It's become difficult to feed everyone, so even in old age, they survive by doing manual labor jobs.
.
A century ago, there was an estimated 10 million elephants across sub-Saharan Africa. Today, in 2021, there are, at best, 400,000 left in the wild, mainly due to poaching for their ivory.
.
Zimbabwe has the 2nd highest population in Africa, perhaps 65,000 as of 2020. But since 1965, the country has engaged in the periodic culling of elephant herds, families, & individuals, due to what is regarded as an excess population.
.
Once upon a time, there would have been no such thing as an “excess population,” because there would have been enough land for them to roam. But with habitat loss & destruction, & human encroachment, this forces elephants into the remaining uninhabited areas, resulting in damaged woodlands from overgrazing. And then the culling begins.
With climate change, the situation becomes much worse, as vegetation and woodland dies off & burns, and humans and wild animals search for what remains.
.
And so to Mak. It was 1986. Mak’s mother was one of those culled. Mak, a traumatized calf, was rescued. As he grew, he became too much for his carers. So he ended up at @imire_zimbabwe when he was about 5. (He’s now 36). It took many years to gain his trust, but now once granted, it is there for life.
