I’m kind of in love with Harriet. 
Except that she’s an owl.
Photo : HARRIET AND PEOPLE IN FOG, ZIMBABWE, 2020, photographed in the same frame as people, from the new series, The Day May Break.

Harriet is 35 years old, a giant eagle owl. When she was just a chick, she was rescued from a forest that was being cleared. Ever since, she has lived at Kuimba Shiri Bird Sanctuary. Like many of the birds rescued by Kuimba Shiri as chicks, she would not survive if reintroduced into the wild.

The Day May Break is the first part of a global series portraying people and animals impacted by environmental destruction. The people in the photos have all been badly affected by climate change - displaced & impoverished by years-long severe droughts and cyclones.
.
The photos were taken at 5 sanctuaries/ conservancies. The animals are almost all rescues, due to everything from poaching of their parents to habitat destruction & poisoning.
.
These animals can never be released back into the wild. Now habituated, the people & animals were PHOTOGRAPHED TOGETHER IN THE SAME FRAME.
.
Created by fog machines on location, the fog causes a once-recognizable world to fade from view.
.
However, these people & animals are the survivors. And there lies possibility and hope.
