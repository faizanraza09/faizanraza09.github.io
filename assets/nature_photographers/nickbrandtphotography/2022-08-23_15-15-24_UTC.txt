10 x behind the scenes photos on The Day May Break, Chapter One.

Because these animals were rescues - victims of everything from poaching of their parents to habitat destruction & poisoning - the people whom I photographed had to come to where the animals were. 
In the weeks before the shoot, several researchers traveled the country, meeting people impacted by climate change. Many were climate refugees, displaced from their homes by years-long droughts and cyclones. For some, their misfortune has been extreme. 

But throughout their time on the shoot, they were all unfailingly gracious, dignified and patient. It helped that all the animals were so calm and accommodating, with no signs of stress, clearly well cared for by their keepers. 

Nevertheless, the crew and I were astonished by how relaxed everyone was in front of camera around the animals in such close proximity. Occasionally, a rhino or elephant slowly moved over and nudged someone, but they barely flinched in response. 

It spoke to the absolute trust that all of us put in the keepers. They knew the animals so well, and had a truly close affinity with them.

By the way, I carefully chose the 5 sanctuaries / conservancies in Kenya & Zimbabwe where we would photograph based on their reputations. I only wanted the best of partners, whose conservation & rescue work I could endorse. 
It was a pleasure to work with all five, and I hope they benefit from the additional exposure. Perhaps some of you may donate to help the work they do.
