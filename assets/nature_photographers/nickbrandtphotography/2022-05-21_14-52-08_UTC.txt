For those of you in NY planning to visit @aipadphoto this weekend, @atlasgallery is showing:
Fatuma, Ali and Bupa, Kenya 2020, and Lineth and Kini, Bolivia, 2022, all photographed together in the same frame, from the series, The Day May Break.
.
Fatuma & Ali lived as nomads with their livestock in NE Kenya. But from 2010, severe droughts killed all their goats & cows. Everyone fled the area, & a lot of people died. With little food available, Fatuma and Ali were forced to move to a town further south. They are still not able to go back home.
.
Bupa was 9 years old in 1989, when he was rescued from a mass elephant cull in Zimbabwe by the owner of @oljogi Conservancy.
.
Kini, a howler monkey, aged 8 in the photo, was rescued as a baby by @senda_verde Animal Refuge. Kini was burned down one side of her body, the burns likely due to hunters setting fire to forest to force monkeys down out of the trees. The mothers are killed and the babies sold as pets in markets.
However, the orphaned babies usually only survive a few days, and raising howler monkeys in captivity is extremely hard.
It took Kini a long time to recover, cared for in the house of the founders, Vicki and Marcelo. Once recovered, in turn Kini cared for the new baby monkeys that arrived.

Like so many monkeys in Bolivia & S. America, howler monkeys are not just in decline because of habitat destruction, but also because they are captured to be sold as pets.

Lineth : For many years, Lineth’s grandfather Samuel, with his brother Adolfo, worked in the refuge in the Chacaltaya Glacier, the location of Bolivia’s only ski resort, and the world’s highest.
But in the mid-1980’s, the amount of snow began to decrease. By 2009, with climate change, the glacier had disappeared completely.
Tourists no longer came. The resort shut down, and is now a ghost town. Samuel, and Adolfo, were left without a job, his family now supported by the artisanal work of his wife Martha.
