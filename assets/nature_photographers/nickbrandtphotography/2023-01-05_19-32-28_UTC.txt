Excellent profile feature in The Independent Photographer (@theindependentphoto) by Josh Bright, Senior Editor and Curator. 

Josh very kindly writes:
“One of the most influential photographers of our time, Brandt’s powerful black-and-white imagery articulately conveys the devastating impact of environmental destruction and climate change on our planet.”

Of Inherit the Dust, in which life-size prints of unreleased animal portraits are placed in locations where animals once roamed, but, due to human intervention, no longer do (a couple of photos in the slide show here), Josh writes:

“The large-scale panoramic photographs are uniquely powerful.  Simultaneously beautiful and shocking, they convey the dramatic scale of destruction in the region, the majestic animals strike a deeply sad sight, juxtaposed against the quarries, factories, and rubbish heaps that once were vast open plains.”
