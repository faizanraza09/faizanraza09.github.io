Please check out the conversation I had with Jo-Anne McArthur, the founder of We Animals Media (@weanimals), about our photographic work. Read it at:

https://weanimalsmedia.org/2022/08/18/nick-brandt-and-jo-anne-mcarthur-on-photography-and-creating-change-for-animals/

Jo-Anne is an inspiring life force - a truly dedicated brave photographer who for many years now has documented and exposed how animals have been abused around the world in industries and more.

Jo started We Animals some years ago to bring visibility to hidden animals through photo & video journalism. Their mission is to document the stories of animals in the human environment — those used for food, fashion, entertainment, and experimentation — and to connect those stories to the individuals and organizations who can amplify their reach.

With their global network of photographers and videographers, their work is available for free to anyone working to inspire compassion & change.

I am, quite simply, in awe of these photographers. In a way, they are like war photographers, except witness to a war that so many people have little idea exists, or choose to suppress that exists. This takes enormous inner strength and bloody-minded determination to illuminate the mass extermination that unfolds every second of every day across the planet.

The photo here is one of Jo’s favorites of mine :
RICHARD AND GRACE, ZIMBABWE, 2020, photographed together, from the The Day May Break.

Richard is a former maize farmer & cattle owner who due to years of droughts intensified by climate change now struggles to provide for his family and send his kids to school.

Grace - a bateleur eagle - was rescued Kuimba Shiri Bird Sanctuary as a chick 40 years ago from forest clearance.The bateleur is is now listed as endangered.
