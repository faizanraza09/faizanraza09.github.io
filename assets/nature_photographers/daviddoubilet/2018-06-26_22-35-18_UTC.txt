A harp seal pup called white coat waits for its mother to return to the sea ice in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The pups are born in late February and nursed for 12-15 days before their mother abandons them to mate and migrate out of the Gulf. The abandoned pups rely on their fat reserves to survive until they learn to swim and catch prey. Life on the ice is harsh and natural mortality is high. Recent years of higher than normal temperatures have resulted in thin and reduced area ice coverage. March storms break apart the weak ice before the pups are able to survive in the sea causing severe mortality for that year class. 2018 saw a slight increase in sea ice and better survival after multiple years of 90%+ mortality. We continue document life in the ice in this changing sea. // photographed on assignment for @natgeo The Generous Gulf // @thephotosociety @the_explorers_club // #ocean #harpseal #baby #beauty #instagood #climatechange #polar for #moreocean follow @daviddoubilet
