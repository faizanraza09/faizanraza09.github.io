May 23 is World Turtle Day. Meet a green sea turtle hatchling. sea turtles are the ancient mariners in the sea migrating incredible distances to return to their nesting beach to mate and lay their clutch of eggs. Green sea turtles can live to 80+ years but very few make it. Green sea turtles are CITES and IUCN listed endangered species due to loss of nesting beaches, over harvest and by catch in fishing nets. Want to help save turtles? Do not purchase turtle products,  use plastics sparingly  and follow conservation guidelines  near nesting beaches.
