Opal Reef on the Great Barrier Reef. The late largest most iconic coral reef system may be located in Queensland Australia but it really belongs to the world. When I was a kid the Great Barrier was the first reef on my radar of imagination. The worlds largest reef experienced sequential coral bleaching events in 2016 & 2017 affecting more than half of 1400 mile long structure. Thermal stress causes the coral polyp to lose its symbiotic algae that provide color and supplemental nutrients. Unprecedented back to back bleaching have left this great reef with little time to recover and struggling to survive.
