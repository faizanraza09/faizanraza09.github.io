A harp seal pup, called a white coat, waits on a small piece of sea ice in the Gulf of St Lawrence waiting patiently for  its mother to return. Harp seals are born on the sea ice in late February and nursed for 12-15 days before the mothers abandons her pup to mate and migrate northward out of the Gulf. The pups rely on fat reserves as they wait  for a mother that will not return. Hunger, storms or poor ice will force them into the sea to learn how to swim and how to feed. Natural mortality is high in these harsh conditions but has become  extreme, approaching 90%+ in recent years of poor ice or literally no ice formation in the Gulf. In 2017 little ice formed in the Gulf forcing pregnant females to search and search in the open waters. Many held their young and swam out of the Gulf out to the Atlantic Front looking for ice. The population of Harp seals in the Gulf of St. Lawrence may disappear with vanishing ice. // From @natgeo Story: Generous Gulf with @natgeocreative @thephotosociety // #ocean #baby #climatechange #polar #harpseal #gulfofstlawrence #canada // #PORTLAND OR join us for the story of the harp seal in Coral Kingdoms and Empires of Ice with at National Geographic Live at the Portland'5 Newmark Theatre NOV 20 at 7:30 pm. // for #moreocean follow @daviddoubilet
