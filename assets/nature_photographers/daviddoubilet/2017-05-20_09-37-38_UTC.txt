Hidden Doom. A small fish unknowingly drifts over a stargazer buried in the soft sediment bottom in Anilao Philippines. Stargazers are ambush predators that bury themselves in the sand and wait for unsuspecting prey to pass overhead. This image was taken at night with underwater lights that exposed the prey so I moved on not wanting to "cause" the predation.
