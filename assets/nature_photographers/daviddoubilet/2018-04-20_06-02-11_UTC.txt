As I board a plane heading to the Southern Line Islands of Kiribati late tonight  I am pleased to share  that my personal favorite photo of the Circle of Barracuda is a part of the Earth Day @natgeocreative Flash Sale of collectible prints from a number of my colleagues that spend their lives documenting wildlife and wild places. A percentage of the proceeds  from the Flash Sale will support conservation, science and storytelling. The sale starts today at 9 am April 20th-28th. Visit the link in my profile to see all of the signed prints from my colleagues available for $100.
