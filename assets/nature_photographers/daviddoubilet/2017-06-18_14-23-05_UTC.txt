Salute to fathers in the sea. A male cardinal fish carries a clutch of eggs in his mouth to protect them from predators in Dumaguete Philippines. This behavior is called "mouth brooding". The male will occasional exhale all of the eggs to aerate  them and quickly inhale them back into the safety of his mouth. // Photographed on current assignment for @natgeo story  Philippines, An Ocean Nation with @jenniferhayesig  @thephotosociety // #ocean #fathersday #fathers #Philippines #CoralTriangle for #moreocean follow @jenniferhayesig and @daviddoubilet
