Waves and wind sculpt a grounded iceberg in Blanley Bay in the Canadian Arctic. Icebergs are a good metaphor for the sea: a large percentage of an iceberg  is normally hidden from our human eye. We discovered a bay filled with grounded icebergs that resembled an Arctic art gallery. Sadly this beauty is too often generated by the rapid retreat of melting glaciers in a warming Arctic. When I can I try to make these types of half and half images because they make a connection between the surface and the secret world below. // with @natgeoexpeditions @natgeo @lindbladexp // #oceans #arctic #icebergs #climatechange #climatesummit #polar #ThisIsEarth #ExploreMore for #MoreOcean follow @daviddoubilet
