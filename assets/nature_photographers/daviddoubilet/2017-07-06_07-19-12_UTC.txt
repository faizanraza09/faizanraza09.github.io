Garden eels sway and feed in the swift current off Dumaguete, Philippines. These social creatures live in large colonies that extend great distances across the sand bottom. They creatures may look menacing but they are very shy and delicate and disappear the moment they detect your presence. This image was made with a remote camera set just at the edge of the colony. It took hours for the eels to feel safe enough to rise and feed near the new object in their midst. // photographed on my current @natgeo assignment with @jenniferhayesig Philippines, An Ocean Nation. // #Ocean #GardenEel  #CoralTriangle #Philippines #Zen for #moreocean follow  @daviddoubilet
