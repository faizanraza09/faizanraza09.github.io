Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) was a Scottish writer best known for creating the famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. He was a prolific author who wrote not only detective stories but also science fiction, historical fiction, and non-fiction works on subjects such as war, spiritualism, and politics.

Conan Doyle's most famous works include the Sherlock Holmes stories, which feature the iconic detective and his sidekick Dr. Watson solving crimes in Victorian London. These stories were initially published in serial form in magazines such as The Strand and were hugely popular with readers. The first story, "A Study in Scarlet," was published in 1887, and the last, "The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place," was published in 1927. The Sherlock Holmes stories are known for their intricate plots, vivid characters, and the brilliant deductive reasoning of the titular character.

Conan Doyle's other notable works include "The Lost World," a science fiction adventure novel about a group of explorers who discover a hidden plateau in South America inhabited by prehistoric creatures; "The White Company," a historical novel set during the Hundred Years' War; and "The War in South Africa," a non-fiction account of the Second Boer War.

Overall, Conan Doyle's writings spanned a wide range of genres and subjects, but his enduring legacy is undoubtedly his creation of the iconic detective Sherlock Holmes, who remains one of the most beloved and recognizable literary characters of all time.
